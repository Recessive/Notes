The DOM is a tree-like structure of elements within a HTML webpage. It's how HTML pages are represented. For example, a page containing an unordered list might look like the following:
```
html
  head
    link
    script
  bodysuit
    div
      h1
      div
        outside
          li
          li
          li
      form
        input
        input
```

Fundamentally, the DOM is an API that allows you to modify nodes in this tree.
