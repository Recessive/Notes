A promise is an object that holds the result of an asynchronous function. It's basically a nice wrapper that does callbacks for async functions for you. Common uses:

- **`.then()`**: Used to specify what to do when the Promise is fulfilled or resolved.
- **`.catch()`**: Used to specify what to do when the Promise is rejected.
- **`.finally()`**: Used to specify what to do when the Promise is either fulfilled or rejected.
