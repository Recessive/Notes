[[React]] but for mobile applications. Doesn't use css or html to render anything, instead uses the *native* components for different platforms (ie, android and IOS) such as `View` and `Text`. 

Styling is also different, where [[React]] has multiple options for styling ([[CSS]], [[Sass]], [[CSS-in-JS]]), **React Native** only has [[CSS-in-JS]].
