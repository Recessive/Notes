**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface

Allows two systems to communicate regardless of differing languages and architecture between the two systems.

An **API** endpoint is something that can be requested and return a response. An example could be requesting a users latest post on Facebook, under something that could be like "latestUserPost" in the API. "latestUserPost" would be an endpoint.

Of course, that's an endpoint adhering to the [[REST]] standard. if you were using [[GraphQL]], 
*below are assumptions*
the api would more or less just be documentation. The only exposed endpoint would just be the ability to send a JSON object and get the data ur looking for.
