#Receiver Operating Characteristic
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)

Simply a plot of the [[True Positive]] rate against the [[False Positive]] rate. Originally called Receiver Operating Characteristic for military radar receivers, it's just kept its name since.

The plot is constructed by varying some threshold in the model and observing the [[True Positive|TPR]] vs [[False Positive|FPR]] for this threshold. Generally, this is done until a complete curve is assembled.
