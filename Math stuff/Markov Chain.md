A Markov Chain is a model describing a set of events that each have a probability of occurring from other events. 

It's basically a fancy way of describing the probability of each thing in the set occurring when you are in a certain state.

So if you're in state A, most likely you'll stay in state A in the next time step, since state A has an 80% chance to go back to itself.

Any state with a 100% chance to stay the same is called a "sink state"
