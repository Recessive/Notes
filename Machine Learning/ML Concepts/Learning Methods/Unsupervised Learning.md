# Unsupervised Learning
Learning where labels **are not** readily available (unlike [[Supervised Learning]]). Examples include K-Means, or [[Contrastive Learning#Unsupervised|Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning]].

## Self Supervised
A subset of unsupervised where the model generates it's own labels. Largely used with [[Contrastive Learning]] and GANs

A **Self Supervised** task is called a **pretext task** and aim to automatically generate pseudo labels. **SimCLR**, a network by Google attempts to do just this task
