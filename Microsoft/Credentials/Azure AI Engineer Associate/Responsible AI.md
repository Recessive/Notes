Core principles:

# Fairness
[[AI]] systems should treat all people equally.
# Reliability and Safety
[[AI]] systems should have high reliability for the level of safety required. For example, a disease diagnosing system should be extremely reliable (should it though lol, really it should just be better than a human)

# Privacy and security
In the name

# Inclusiveness
Woke shit

# Transparency
LOL like Microsoft can talk. "Their" definition is: 
[[AI]] systems should be understandable. User should be aware of their limitations.

# Accountability
People should be accountable
