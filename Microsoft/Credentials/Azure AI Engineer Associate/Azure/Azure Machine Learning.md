Cloud-based platform for training [[Machine Learning]] models and publishing the trained models as services.

Features include:
- **Automated Machine Learning**: Enables noobs to train models
- **Azure Machine Learning Designer**: Drag and drop ML
- **Data and computer management**: Standard cloud compute stuff
- **Pipelines**: Hands-on design for training, deployment and management of entire systems
Azure ML is made for data scientists to:
1. Prepare data
2. EDA + Training
3. Deploy
Azure ML is made for software engineers to:
1. Be stupid and use drag and drop ML/ automated ML
2. Rely entirely on data scientists to do their job for them (aka "collaborate")
3. Use Azures SDK and CLI to orchestrate DevOps. Basically, manage ML efficiently between teams.
