An applied [[Azure AI Services||Azure AI Service]] that allows for complex indexing of arbitrary data. For example, data could be images, videos or text.

You can also extract additional data to enhance the index such as descriptions and key phrases to summarize documents/files. This is referred to as an *enrichment pipeline*.
