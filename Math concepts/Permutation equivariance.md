# Permutation equivariance

More or less just means if you permute some data, then apply a function to it, you will end up with the same result as if you applied the function first, then permuted the data. So for some function $f$, some input $x$ and some permutation of $x$ $P$:

$$f(x)^P = f(x^P)$$
